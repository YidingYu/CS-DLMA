CS-DLMA is a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol for heterogeneous wirless networking. The underpinning technique of CS-DLMA is deep Q-network (DQN). However, conventional DQN algorithms cannot fit in with the specicial issues in CSMA protocols design. We put forth a new DQN algorithm to address these issuses.
